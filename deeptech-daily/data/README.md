# Data directory

This folder stores machine-readable artefacts generated by
[`tools/daily_update.py`](../tools/daily_update.py). Each file mirrors a section
in the public README so you can consume the intel programmatically.

Files are overwritten on every run, but the script preserves the `generated_at`
timestamp when the actual payload is unchanged. This makes it easy to diff the
outputs across commits without introducing noisy churn.

Data formats:

- `*.yaml` — easy-to-read summaries for feeds such as arXiv or Hacker News.
- `gpu_prices.json` — structured GPU pricing information, including provider
  metadata and human-readable error messages when available.

If you want to ingest the outputs elsewhere, prefer reading from this directory
instead of scraping the Markdown tables.
