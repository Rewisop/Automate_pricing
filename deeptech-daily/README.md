![Daily Update](https://github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY:-deeptech-daily}/actions/workflows/daily-update.yml/badge.svg)

DeepTech Daily Intel publishes a rolling snapshot of the AI hardware and
research landscape. The sections below are rewritten by
[`tools/daily_update.py`](tools/daily_update.py) whenever the automation runs.
Human-authored documentation lives alongside the autogenerated content so that
contributors understand how the report is produced.

## How the daily update works

1. **Fetch sources.** Each section corresponds to a `collect_*` function inside
   `tools/daily_update.py`. The functions make lightweight HTTP calls to public
   APIs and summarise the results into Markdown tables or bullet lists.
2. **Persist machine-readable data.** The same information is exported to the
   [`data/`](data) directory in JSON or YAML format, enabling downstream use in
   dashboards or notebooks.
3. **Rewrite README sections.** Markers of the form `<!--XYZ:START-->` and
   `<!--XYZ:END-->` wrap each autogenerated block. The script replaces only the
   content between the markers, so you can safely edit the prose surrounding
   them.
4. **Render the dashboard.** The datasets are transformed into a static HTML
   dashboard at `../docs/index.html`, ready for GitHub Pages.

To run the updater locally:

```bash
python tools/daily_update.py
```

The updater prints `changed: True/False`, writes the GitHub Pages dashboard,
emits structured logs, and by default runs `git diff --quiet || git commit -am
"daily refresh" && git push` from the repository root. Set
`DEEPTECH_AUTO_COMMIT=0` to skip the commit/push step or
`DEEPTECH_AUTO_COMMIT_CMD` to supply a custom command.

Environment variables such as `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`
increase API limits. See the repository root [`README`](../README.md) for full
setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Markers missing?** The updater expects every section defined in
  `SECTION_BUILDERS` to appear in this README. If you add a new section, insert
  matching start/end markers before running the script.
- **API rate limits.** Provide authentication tokens or reduce the polling
  frequency when a provider responds with HTTP `403` or `429` errors.
- **No file changes reported.** If the script prints `changed: False`, the
  latest run produced identical output to the previous commit—this is expected
  when providers have not updated their data.
